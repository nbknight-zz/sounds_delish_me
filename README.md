# README

This is a working version of my group's MVP used for our capstone project at Tech Talent South.

It uses Ruby 2.4.1

There is minimal bootstrap used. We used the Gem HIRB in order to make database more readable.

We removed the db file from the .gitignore.  If you run it on your local server and you cannot load it run a db:migrate and a db:seed.

The seed file conatains the categories.

The pictures are loaded in the uploaders folder.

It uses Rails 5.2 so you do not need Carrierwave.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
